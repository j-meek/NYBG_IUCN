1313900,170440,Vigna hosei,Data Deficient,,2016,2013-04-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Vigna hosei</span> is globally assessed as Data Deficient as there is currently insufficient information available to evaluate this species. Although the species is reported to be Endangered in Africa which is outside of its native range (Maxted <em>et al</em>. 2004), little is known about its population distribution, size and trend across its native range in southeast Asia. Due to the value of this species in cultivation and potential use in crop improvement it is important that it is actively conserved both in Asia and in Africa to ensure as much genetic diversity is protected as possible for its long-term survival and its use in plant breeding. An ecogeographic survey of southeast Asian populations is recommended to determine its current conservation status and to inform planning for the establishment of appropriate conservation actions, both <em>in situ</em> and <em>ex situ</em>.","<em>Vigna hosei</em> is a prostrate perennial herb with a yellow flower with a pale yellow beak; it often forms thick ground cover and is found in grass at roadsides and in disturbed habitats or wastelands, on damp ground and on sandy loam from 21–200 m a.s.l. in Africa and under 500 m a.s.l. in southeast Asia (Maxted <em>et al. </em>2004, eFloras 2012).","There are few herbarium&#160;specimens&#160;and accessions of <em>Vigna hosei</em> stored <em>ex situ</em>, this indicates that it is a rare species (Maxted <em>et al</em>. 2004).

It is suspected that the population has decreased due to a decline in the quality and extent of habitat during the past 30 years, and that it may be continuing to decrease due to continued coastal development; mainly for tourism. However, analysis of the currently available data does not indicate that the population may have declined by as much as 30% (i.e. the minimum threshold to assess the species as Vulnerable). Further, despite the extent of occurrence (EOO) estimated to be 9,156 km² (i.e., below the minimum threshold of 20,000 km² to assess the species as Vulnerable), there are insufficient data available to conclude that the population is severely fragmented, or that the number of locations ≤10, and it is not known whether there are extreme fluctuations in the population. The available data are also insufficient to justify assessing the species as Near Threatened. A survey is therefore needed to collect the necessary data to reassess this species.","It is found in steep coastal areas, fossile dunes (Pujadas Salvà 2003), grassy areas near coastal cliffs, limestone, together with <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Crucianella </span>spp., <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Helichrysum </span>spp., <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Iberis </span>spp. and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Beta vulgaris </span>ssp. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">maritima </span>(Magos Brehm 2009).

The taxon grows in  temperatures ranging from 12.5–17.5ºC, with a higher number of  records in the range of 16–17.5ºC. Radiation has been recorded in the  range of 140–165 Kcal/cm² with incidence in 155–160  Kcal/cm² and sunlight of 2,400 to &gt;3,000 hrs, with a higher number of records at 2,800–2,900 hours. It is found at  sites with &lt;400–1,200 mm of rainfall (with a higher number of records  at sites with 400–700 mm) and 50–75 rainy days.

The only confirmed records of collections of this morphological form of the genus are from 1922 in Walsingham Bay and 1913 in Gibbet Island.

Existing genetic data for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Halodule</span> specimens from Bermuda do not match the original morphological type that was described as <em>H. bermudensis</em>.<br/><br/><em>Halodule bermudensis</em> is listed as Data Deficient due to the currently undetermined taxonomic status ( i.e. whether the species is a distinct from <em>H. wrightii</em>). However, it is very important to determine the validity of this species since its extremely limited range in Bermuda would qualify it for a threatened category if found to be valid. It could possibly be extinct in fact as no recent specimens matching the original description have been found in recent years.It is highly recommended that more surveys are carried out, and that both genetic and morphological evidence, particularly developmental flowering structure, be used to determine its taxonomic and conservation status.","<em>Halodule bermudensis</em> has only been identified from two very shallow subtidal locations, both where the seagrass is exposed at extreme low tides.

For further details see the <a href=""http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/redlists/petitions.htm"">IUCN SSC web site</a>. <br/> <br/>The SPWG received the justification of the petitioner on 9 November 2006. The SPWG did not receive a justification from the Red List Authority (RLA) or any further evidence from them relating to the listing, so deliberations on the existing listing could only be informed by very limited information available in the IUCN Red List. <br/> <br/>The justification of the petitioner, although well over the specified page limit, contained very little information directly relevant to the listing it was arguing against. The lack of any information from the RLA and the shortage of relevant information from the petitioner made it very difficult for the SPWG to make an informed ruling. The available data were not sufficient to make an assessment, and result in the ruling that the appropriate category is Data Deficient (DD). <br/> <br/>It is important to note that the DD ruling does not necessarily mean that there are not sufficient data to make a listing. Although the SPWG was unable to obtain sufficient data to make an assessment, it is very likely that a group of experts familiar with the species would be able to do this. In the course of its deliberations, SPWG was able to uncover much data and contacted very knowledgeable and helpful experts. Clearly, it should be possible for these experts to come to a consensus view on the estimates that are needed for a listing. Organizing and facilitating this process is the role of the RLA, which needs to be better engaged to support a listing.",The species is a dominant component of a restricted belt of lowland rainforest on brown sand and is also found occasionally in other forest types.,,Unknown,"<em>Chlorocardium rodiei</em> occurs primarily in Guyana, but is also found in Suriname and possibly in Venezuela but this is unsubstantiated. If the species occurs in western Venezuela it is only likely to be at very low densities. Similarly the species in Suriname is confined to a small area along Maratakka River.",,Terrestrial,"To enable continued harvesting of this species, it is imperative that a sustainable logging programme is developed. The TROPENBOS Foundation along with scientists like Dr. Hammond are working hard with the forestry companies and officials in Guyana to achieve this. The programme is looking at many aspects including the logging process itself, the retention of stands capable of ensuring continued production , the reduction of collateral damage, the reduction in the size of logging gaps, the creation of suitably large protected areas and general education of both the producers and the consumers.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Continuing population decline is inferred from destruction and degradation of suitable habitat within its native range. This species is not well represented in <em>ex situ </em>collections, so collection of germplasm material is a priority for this species. This should happen alongside research to ascertain provision of existing&#160;<em>in situ </em>conservation and investigation into opportunities for improving <em>in situ </em>conservation through population monitoring and management, working with local communities to ensure agricultural practices are&#160;sustainable.","In Kenya this species occurs in deciduous bushland from 1,200 to 1,800 m a.s.l.

This species is deemed a high priority taxon by Maxted and Kell (2009) due to its restricted range, being confined to one locality worldwide (Phillips 1972, Bisht and Mukai 2002).<br/><br/>Much of this species' range in Ethiopia overlaps with the Borana conserved landscape, which is a large but officially unrecognised community conserved area (CCA) managed according to indigenous governance (Bassi and Tache 2008). This area is used for pastoralism, and natural resources in this area were previously managed within the local communities where no individual could claim exclusive rights to resources, and use was balanced and sustainable. The area is host to valuable biodiversity, some of which is resultant of the culturally mediated relation between environment and man. However biodiversity decline, including destruction and degradation of open woodland and bushland, recorded in this area is mainly due to the negative effects of government intervention (Bassi 2007, Bassi and Tache 2008).

Collections have been made in 1866, 1954, 1955 and 1978 and notes are made of a few other undated pre-1938 collections (Jonker 1938). There has been much environmental change within this region over this time period and it is possible that many original sites of collection may have been subject to forest loss, which is still ongoing in the region in general. However, it has been recorded from within one, possibly two, protected areas where habitat remains, Gunung Mulu National Park (529 km<sup>2</sup>) and Kubah National Park (22.3 km<sup>2</sup>) in Sarawak.   The population and area of occupancy (AOO) are extremely difficult to infer, as the lack of collection records may reflect a very small population and AOO or difficulty in finding this potentially elusive species. It has undoubtedly suffered declines as a result of forest loss but this is difficult to quantify as the generation length and population size are unknown. The extent of occurrence (EOO) estimated from mapped specimen records exceeds the threshold for a threatened category, even without any records from Sumatera.&#160;However, the only specimen record found from peninsular Malaysia was collected pre-1938 and is in an area which is now largely urbanized and intensively cultivated. If the species is no longer found here the estimated EOO of 8,200 km<sup>2</sup> would fall within the Vulnerable Category.   There is a continuing decline in the area extent and quality of habitat, outside protected areas, with ongoing forest losses. For example, logging and conversion to palm oil plantation is noted to be occurring in areas of forest surrounding the Gunung Mulu National Park (UNESCO 2016). In general, forest fragmentation and isolation, with expanding areas of plantation are all major threats that increase the vulnerability of existing protected areas in Sarawak (Mohd-Azlan and Lawes 2011).&#160;If the more recent collections made on the island of Borneo represent the only localities in which this species occurs then it may be considered to be severely fragmented, as the subpopulation in the Kuching area is approximately 560 km from the subpopulation in Gunung Mulu. However, the fact that forests where older collections have been made are gone does not necessarily mean that it is no longer present in the region. Other similar species in southeast Asia known only from old collections have been rediscovered in other places, others are possibly extinct (V. Merckx pers. comm. 2015).

It is not possible to use criteria requiring population data and percentage declines due to the lack of information. Only three herbarium records were found, collected in 1956 and 1957. This was a time of fairly intensive field work in preparation for the Flora of Hainan and since then collecting has been less intensive and mostly in the mountain areas to the south (M. Gilbert pers. comm. 2016). The  extent of occurrence (EOO) based on these records is estimated to fall within the Critically  Endangered category under criteria B. It is not certain whether this <em>Eriocaulon</em> remains in the areas where it was collected in the 1950s and the locality detail for one of the three specimen records is imprecise, and possibly the records are from only two subpopulations. If two subpopulations remain with ongoing threats then Endangered may be an appropriate category, if only one remains then it becomes Critically Endangered or it may even no longer be present. It is noted that in the four decades prior to 2001 the biodiversity status in Hainan had changed greatly with land use changes, particularly agriculture and tropical plantation expansion (Ouyang <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). With the degree of development and lack of protected areas it is  inferred that there are continuing declines in the area extent and  quality of habitat. However, it is possible that this species exists within small niches within such a system, for example, on paddy rice field margins —cultivated extensively in the northeastern lowlands (Falkenheim 2014)— or even in rubber plantations as a result of the soil and water conservation effects of terracing (Jiang and Wang 2003).

The addition of the locality for the specimen record in Guadalcanal increases the extent of occurrence (EOO) to 485,800 km<sup>2</sup>. The area of occupancy (AOO) is also uncertain. At a minimum, if a 2x2 km<sup>2</sup> grid cell is used, it could be as low as 12 km<sup>2</sup>, but it may also be found more widely in the forest habitat available in the areas of collection, such that it could be much larger. This may be a rare orchid as there are so few records, one collected in 1911 (Cyclops Mountains), two from Mt Maneao, possibly from the same locality, in 1954 and 1956 and one recent specimen from the Solomon Islands in 2014. The population may be small and the sub-populations could also be very small. However, it is possible that this small orchid is easily overlooked among the leaf litter of the forest floor and additionally sampling effort may be low, as many parts of the region are relatively under explored botanically. If the records found truly represent its distribution then it could be considered to be severely fragmented as the localities in New Guinea are more than 1,000 km apart and Guadalcanal is an island more than 1,000 km to the west. The locality detail is precise for Guadalcanal and from satellite imagery the forest habitat appears to be undisturbed. The Cyclops Mountains in Papua have a large protected area where threats and declines in extent and quality of habitat may be inferred to be minimised. However, the locality of collection is not certainly within this reserve and there are ongoing threats in some areas. In the valleys near Mt Maneao satellite imagery shows forest clearance most probably for agricultural activities and also patches of forest clearance that appear to have resulted from logging activity are also visible on hillsides. It is possible that these activities are leading to continuing declines in the extent and quality of the habitat for this orchid. Fires are also a potential threat which could contribute to decline. Numerical population data are lacking and it is not possible to estimate percentage declines. Fragmentation and ongoing declines in the extent and quality of habitat may be considered applicable, but the EOO exceeds the values for a threatened category under Criterion B. The assessment hinges on the AOO for which Endangered, Vulnerable or Least Concern are all possibilities. It is noted that the Cyclops Mountains are a well-studied range (Wikramanayake <em>et al.</em> 2002) and yet no other records for this orchid, other than that collected in 1911, were found here. This implies that the population of this orchid is most likely to be small and the AOO unlikely to be large. If it is suspected to be similar at other localities then the AOO is more likely to fall within a threatened category. However, the recent finding on Guadalcanal suggests that this species may be easily overlooked and could be more widespread than records suggest. In view of the lack of information and range of possible categories it is assessed as Data Deficient. Very little is known about this orchid and further surveys and research are needed.</p>",The collections of this small orchid were made from humus on the forest floor. In Papua New Guinea it was found on bare humus on north slopes in 'oak' forest and also within leaf litter on a steep slope in <em>Castanopsis</em> forest.

The area of occupancy (AOO) in also very problematic, as there are only two specific records, and it is reported to be rare in Viet Nam. It is possible that the AOO may be small or, alternatively, over the wide EOO it may in fact be found elsewhere and its small size and growth habit, on tall shady trees, may mean that it is easily overlooked. There are no population data available with which to make estimates of numerical values and the percentage declines are difficult to infer as locality detail in Myanmar is lacking, and amount of forest loss in the known areas, since the time of collection, are uncertain. This is possibly a widespread species and, although noted to be rare in Viet Nam, it may be more common elsewhere, and the lack of specimen records may represent under-collection, such that Least Concern may be appropriate. However, this species may be genuinely rare, with small populations confined to a few sites with ongoing threats, such that a threatened category could possibly be appropriate. For example, at two sites in northern Viet Nam and one in the south, this orchid was  collected on logged trees in deforested areas and these  populations are considered to be extinct (L.

The species has a wide native range giving an extent of occurrence that exceeds the criteria for a threatened category under criterion B however the size of the population is not known. Research indicates that the population has experienced decline over the last century due to deforestation of its native habitat. The proportion of individuals lost is not known but population decline has resulted in a genetic bottleneck, a loss of genetic diversity and an increase in the occurrence of inbreeding within the population resulting in a decline of the populations' fitness. Also despite the occurrence of the species in secondary forest and its use within riparian afforestation it is here assumed that the overall population trend is decreasing. The species is also threatened by selective logging for timber and the fragmentation of its habitat. <em>Luhea divaricata </em>is globally assessed as Data Deficient. With more information on population loss the species may reach a threatened category under criteria A but until this information is gathered it is not possible to assign a threat category to the species. Population may decline into the future if the threats to the species continue and it becomes more inbred.","<em>Luhea divaricata </em>is a large tree species, attaining 20 to 25 m in height (Conson <em>et al. </em>2013). It has been described as a 'secondary' (Conson <em>et al. </em>2013) or 'pioneer' species due to its occurrence within secondary forests and following forest disturbance (De Carvalho <em>et al. </em>2008). As well as these habitats,&#160;<em>L. divaricata </em>is present in Atlantic Forest, central Brazilian savanna (Esteves 2015) and Pampa (Nagel <em>et al. </em>2015). Within the latter the species grows within small forest patches surrounded by grasslands and agriculture (Nagel <em>et al. </em>2015). The species is often associated within riparian habitats but can also occur on rocky terrain where the canopy is less dense (Conson <em>et al. </em>2013). The tree is tolerant of flooding (De Carvalho <em>et al. </em>2008), the shade and low temperatures (Nagel <em>et al. </em>2015). It is pollinated by hummingbirds and bees while seed dispersal is performed in the wind (Conson&#160;<em>et al. </em>2013, Stefenon <em>et al. </em>2016). Currently, Atlantic forest and Pampa within Brazil is under pressure from agricultural and urban expansion and logging consequently <em>L. divaricata</em>'s native habitat is in decline. It has become more fragmented and smaller in area over the last century.","The population size for the species is not known. As the species is resident in Atlantic Forest (Conson <em>et al. </em>2013) and Brazilian Pampa (Nagel <em>et al. </em>2015), the population is subject to decline and fragmentation. Recent genetic surveys in these two habitats show a high occurrence of genetic inbreeding, and a loss of heterozygosity to an extent that it is lower than anticipated for a tropical tree species (Conson <em>et al. </em>2013, Nagel <em>et al. </em>2015). Both studies also found that there was growing genetic differentiation between sites but there has been an overall genetic bottleneck, which is assumed to be caused by deforestation (Conson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Nagel&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Genetic bottlenecks were also identified in southern subpopulations of the species (Stefenon <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;Stefenon <em>et al. </em>(2016) also identified lower fitness in these subpopulations and a decline in germination capacity which was directly linked to the increase in inbreeding. These observations identify a loss of genetic diversity that could negatively impact regeneration and result in further population decline. Within the Brazilian Pampa the subpopulation resides in 'forest nucleations' within grasslands and agricultural space suggesting local fragmentation of the subpopulation (Nagel <em>et al. </em>2015). This tree is also subject to selective logging that consequently causes further decline. However, the species is regularly used in afforestation projects and can persist well in secondary forest (Conson <em>et al. </em>2013) so in areas were this occurs the population is increasing in size.<br/><br/>Overall, due to the threats to species' habitat, population and genetic structure we conclude that the overall population is in decline. At present, we cannot estimate the potential historic or future decline in the species population until we are confident in the the status of the species within each of its range countries.",Decreasing,"This species is native to South America.

It can be used for the production of boxes, tool handles, musical instruments, plywood, posts and for construction (Grandtner <em>et al. </em>2013). It can also locally be used for charcoal, fire wood and as a street tree (Grandtner <em>et al. </em>2013). Essential oils may also be extracted from its flowers. In traditional medicine extracts and decoctions from the bark and other parts of the plant can be used to treat dysentery, leucorrhoea, rheumatism, bronchitis, tumours and skin lesions (Courtes <em>et al. </em>2015). Recent biochemical assays have shown the species' leaves contain flavanoids, tannins, sapnonins and that the species has antioxidant properties. Medicinal research is occurring for use of the species is treatments for diseases such as Huntington's disease (Courtes <em>et al. </em>2015).<br/><br/>The species is also becoming commonly used in afforestation projects, particularly along riverbanks in riparian ecosystems (Conson <em>et al. </em>2013).",Terrestrial,This species is reported from 21 <em>ex situ </em>collections (BGCI PlantSearch 2017) and the species is known from protected areas.

The species in its strict sense has been observed on very few occasions, and the known populations consist of less than ten plants. The number of mature individuals is not known, but is certainly less than 1,000. The estimated area of occupancy is 2 km<sup>2</sup>, based on available records, and the extent of occurrence is around 20 km<sup>2</sup>. The species has apparently been extremely rare since its discovery, is known from very few records, and is potentially impacted by the loss and degradation of habitat (due to encroachment of woodland) as a result of the decline of traditional management and grazing regimes. The species is assessed as Data Deficient at present as, although it is considered rare, with fewer than 1,000 mature individuals, and has a restricted distribution, there is no evidence of a continuing population change, and although habitat change as a result of declining grazing and habitat management is a plausible threat, the scope and scale of impacts from this threat this is not known. Further study is recommended to better understand the plant, its requirements, population size and trend, distribution, threats and taxonomic identity, and ex situ conservation suggested (artificial propagation, reintroduction, seed collection).","Typical habitat is disturbed open ground, including disturbed mountain pastures (<em>Pyke et al.</em> 2016) and scree slopes. Substrate varies from stony to clayey soil. The reference to humid clay soils is misleading. The discoverer of the species, P. Font y Quer, stated that the specimen grew on clay soil close to a spring, which some authors interpreted to be wet places. However, in <em>Flórula de Cardó </em>(1950) Font y Quer emphasised that it had been found growing in a dry place next to the spring, and had since disappeared from that site due to human activity. Recent observations confirm that it is not a wetland or fontane plant, but rather a species of unstable substrates in areas of Mediterranean scrub vegetation.","This species is at present known from just two localities, where the populations consist of a few individuals, each forming a sward due to the presence of ‘rhizomes’.

The population trend is unknown, and it is seldom collected (Pyke <em>et al. </em>2016). The population at the type locality has been lost, but there is insufficient information to suggest a continuing decline. The number of mature individuals is not known, and given the rhizomatous growth form, an accurate count would be difficult.

La Croix&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(1991) described&#160;this species<em>&#160;</em>as 'usually occurring as scattered plants'. However, this species has also been noted as gregarious between 1,670–1,830 m asl, then rather rare between 1,830–1,920 m asl in&#160;<em>Brachystegia&#160;</em>woodland (st Claire-Thompson no: 478). A collection of this species was made from a colony of 17 individuals growing under a non-native&#160;<em>Jacaranda&#160;</em>tree (Biegel no: 3542).",Decreasing,"This orchid species occurs across south-central Africa in Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Mozambique. This species has a wide distribution within Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Tanzania and does not seem confined to a particular area within these countries. A single collection of this species was made on Mount Chiperone in northern Mozambique (Correia and Merques no: 2492), but it is unknown whether this species occurs elsewhere in Mozambique. The type collection was made at Blanytre in Malawi (Scott no: s.n.). This species occurs at elevations from 950–2,072 m asl.","The tubers of <em>Satyrium</em><em>&#160;</em>species are a main harvesting target for&#160;<em>Chikanda&#160;</em>production (Bingham 2000), and this species is known to be wild-harvested for this purpose. Veldman&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2017) confirmed using genetic analysis that this species was a component in two separate samples of&#160;<em>Chikanda&#160;</em>cake bought from a market on the Tanzanian - Zambian border in 2013.&#160;<em>Chikanda</em>&#160;is a traditional Zambian dish produced from ground orchid tubers,&#160;which has seen a recent rapid rise in demand from urban areas. It is mainly harvested and consumed in Zambia, although a similar trade exists in Tanzania with a dish known as&#160;<em>Kinaka&#160;</em>(Davenport and Ndangalasi 2003).&#160;Due to rising demand in Zambia, there is a growing trade in tubers taking place across the Tanzanian border. Despite this species being covered under CITES Appendix II, cross-border trade of this species is currently unregistered and unregulated. Davenport and Ndangalasi (2003), estimated that the number of orchid plants being transported from Tanzania to Zambia for&#160;<em>Chikanda</em>&#160;is between 2.2 and 4.1 million annually. They estimated the value of this trade to be 0.25 million USD per annum.",Terrestrial,"<p>A current Darwin initiative is working towards the protection and conservation of this and other <em>Chikanda&#160;</em>orchid species (Bone 2016). This includes assessing the extinction risk of orchid species thought to be particularly threatened, and propagation of&#160;<em>Chikanda</em>&#160;orchid species for subsistence cultivation to reduce the levels of wild-harvesting.

Additionally, its potential as a keystone plant resource was identified by Diaz-Martin <em>et al. </em>(2014) because of its importance in community stability and diversity. Seedlings grow well on tree-fall gaps, which gives them a higher chance of completing their life cycles (Romo Reátequi 2005, Cintra and Horna 1997).","There is little information regarding populations of <em>Dipteryx micrantha. </em>However, a study carried out in the Manu National Park showed that recruitment occurs both in mature and late successional forests, and that higher densities of all size classes were found in the margins of lakes and swamps (Romo <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Another study carried out in the Ucayali district of the Peruvian Amazon showed that <em>D. micrantha </em>and <em>D. alata</em>&#160;seedlings respond well to initial post-logging conditions (Putzel <em>et al. </em>2011). International demand for <em>Dipteryx</em>&#160;wood has reduced <em>Dipteryx</em>&#160;spp. populations in the Peruvian Amazon (Putzel <em>et al. </em>2008). A recent study suggests the existence of two different &#160;morphotypes of <em>D. micrantha</em>&#160;with different geographical distributions within the Peruvian Amazon&#160;(Aldana Gomero <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;Additionally, recent habitat fragmentation may contribute with genetic differentiation among populations, which will result in population decline, as has been the case with <em>Dipteryx alata</em>&#160;in the Brazilian <em>cerrado&#160;</em>(Collevatti <em>et al. </em>2013).",Decreasing,"<em>Dipteryx micrantha </em>&#160;is endemic to South America.

According to Grandtner and Chevrette (2013) <em>D. micrantha</em>&#160;fruits have ornamental value.

Nevertheless, nothing remains known about the historical localities, the population trends, and the current situation in one of the two subpopulations (Qara Dagh Mountain). Even in the other subpopulation (Zawita area), our knowledge is very poor and superficial.<br/><br/>It is why from a pessimist and minimalist point of view, the very low number of individuals effectively known (around 115) and a possible decline could allow us to consider the Critically Endangered category. But from an optimist and maximalist point of view, we can reasonably suppose that the Zawita subpopulation size is higher with a higher number of location not yet discovered and that the Qara Dagh Mountain subpopulation also has not disappeared and its size could be higher more. In this second case, including threats caused by harvesting, the species could be only Near Threatened.

The collection from Hollandia (Jayapura) is suspected to have been made in lowland rainforest, where threats are most intense, particularly urban expansion and agricultural developments and it is possibly no longer present in the original area of collection and could be Critically Endangered, and at worst even possibly Extinct in the wild here. Although, if it has a wide elevational range, it is also possible that it may be found within the Cyclops Mountain Strict Nature Reserve, in areas where threats are not operational. However, this is a relatively well collected area, for example, there were several expeditions to this area to study fauna and flora in the 1930s (Papua Insect Foundation 2015) and in 2000, Bogor Botanic Garden Team carried out an exploration to the Cyclops Mountain Nature Reserve (Astuti and Rugayah 2016), but no further records of this species are known. The population may have suffered significant declines and now be small or very small, but there is insufficient information to make an evaluation under these criteria. The area of occupancy (AOO) based on a 2x2 km grid cell for the two possible collection would be only 8 km². The extent of occurrence (EOO) based on this would also be 8 km² but could be larger, <em>ca</em> 800 km² if it were to occur in the Cyclops Mountains and around the bay area and larger still if it is found between here and the collection locality near Manokwari.
